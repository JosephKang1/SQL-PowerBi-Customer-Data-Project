# SQL-PowerBi-Customer-Data-Project

In this example I generated a sample csv file that imitates real world values for customers. 
In this case it includes Customer Id	First Name	Last Name	Email	Phone	Birthday	Age	Age Band	Gender	Occupation	Education Level	Company	Country	City	Address	Postal Code
The data is then manipulated and observed using MySql and visualized in Power Bi.
